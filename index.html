          <p>
            I have a confession...<br /><br />

            I've always been scared of my car...<br /><br />

            The thought of washing it was overwhelming, and I couldn't stand to
            spend money on detailing all the time.<br /><br />

            But it had gone too far.<br /><br />

            Washing your car is a dirty job, but somebody has to do it,
            right?<br /><br />

            For many of us, that means driving around town looking for a car
            wash and waiting in line while the other customers are getting their
            cars done.<br /><br />

            Every time I'd get my car washed, it took a lot of time and money
            out of my day (not to mention the cost of gas).<br /><br />

            So I started wonderingâ€¦<br /><br />

            What if there was an easier way? <br /><br />

            A better way? <br /><br />

            And most importantly - is there something else I can use to clean my
            car besides water?<br /><br />

            And then I saw the ad on my feed.<br /><br />

            This company came out with something called
            <a href="https://ethoscarcare.com/products/defy-microfiber-kit"
              >DEFY</a
            >
            - they said it's 3 in 1, so you can use it to clean your car without
            water or making a mess...even if you go months between car washes!
            (which I did!)<br />
          </p>

          <img
            style="width: 100%"
            src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0019/4854/9220/products/defy-eth-defy-8oz-709293_1080x.jpg?v=1606117564"
          />

          <p>
            So, I took a shot and ordered a bottle and microfiber cloth kit to
            try it out.<br /><br />

            My order arrived surprisingly fast, and I was ready to go!<br /><br />

            I watched a quick video of Tim, the company's founder, demonstrating
            how to use the product, and I was off to the races.<br /><br />

            The rest is history.<br /><br />

            Now my car is shining like new again every day, not just because
            it's clean but because DEFY makes sure that dirt doesn't stick
            around for long either!<br /><br />

            DEFY is the best car detailing secret that almost no one knows
            about, and it's changing how I wash my car forever.<br /><br />
